# RESTful Node.js example

This is just a simple Node.js example of a REST service which gives access to a Mongo database.
This project is inspired by a [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/node-js-express-rest-web-services/table-of-contents).
The project is neither complete nor a demonstration about how I would do a similar project.
